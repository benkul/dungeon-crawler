dungeon-crawler
===============

my first student project - a generative dungeon crawler

This is a pre-understanding-of-classes student project. It is written in Python 2.7.  

It relies heavily on random generation and chance.  The game served as inspiration for the more ambitious Super Ultra Fun Time Quest, which fixes many of the issues with Dungeon-Crawler.

As I had friends play the game, I noticed that it relied too heavily on random chance in central game mechanics. A player could die on the first turn without warning, for example, and the room choices offered no meaningful choices.
